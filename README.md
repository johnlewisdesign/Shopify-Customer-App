# Shopify-Customer-App

## A private Shopify app that shows customer data, products and recent orders on the app's dashboard page. Also an API to XML output used for deploying orders via a third party system with no API, Clarity MIS. A full two way PHP private app of this is also built and on backup.

Callback handler routes are located in the root. Please note these files all need keys and secrets. This must be https:// a per Shopify standard.

_Disclaimer: In an ideal world I would have wrote less code, but time was tight on this one, hence the multiple API entries for the callback handler! Sue me :) Seriously though...I'll branch it at some point!_

### please note API keys have been removed. Rename conf.example.php to conf.php to get started with the main app in /shopjld.

This uses the 2019-04 API.
